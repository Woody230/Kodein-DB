# Project paused

Following our [Anouncement to moving to KOSI-Libs](https://medium.com/kodein-koders/moving-forward-with-the-kodein-open-source-initiative-9fc4f6160c84), we anounced that Kodein-DB would not be maintained in its current form.

Our Embedded Multiplatform NoSQL Document Database will come back, as we are still working on it, with a refined & simplified API.
It will **not** be compatible with Kodein-DB.
