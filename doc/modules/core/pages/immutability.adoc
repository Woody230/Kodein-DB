[[immutability]]
= Immutability requirement

Kodein-DB works under the assumption that your models (ie. the objects that are going to be managed by the database) are immutable.
This can be seen as paradoxical for a database library: you need to be able to update your data!

Kodein-DB is a document based NoSQL library, it works much like a folder drawer.

- Inserting a document is like printing a new document and putting it inside the appropriate drawer at the correct position.
- Updating a document is like printing the updated document, and putting it inside the drawer, removing the old outdated document.

With this analogy, you can see that the document themselves are immutable: you do not scrible over a document, you print a new version to replace the old one.

Kodein-DB works the same way: each of your object model must be immutable, and you should create a new model to update one:

[source,kotlin]
.A simple example
----
val john = db[johnKey] ?: error("No John!")
val newJohn = john.copy(phone = "0605040302")
db.put(newJohn)
----

IMPORTANT: There is no way (yet?) in Kotlin to ensure immutability.
While we cannot force you to use immutable models, we highly recommend that you do.
Using mutable models will eventually lead to data races, and very hard to find bugs.

The Object Cache will check for mutability in its cached models.
It uses hashcode for this, which is far from foolproof, and throws a `ModelMutatedException` when it detects one.
This behaviour can be disabled by passing the `ModelCache.NoHashCodeImmutabilityChecks` option when opening the database.
